      <p> Horrid henry was my favourite cartoon growing up. It felt relatable and humouroius to watch. I felt on cloud nine while seeing it. It is one of my favourite memories from childhood.It felt as if i was the third person and everything was happening in real life. Although now it has stopped producing its show on cartoon plus, it became a series on netflix which I watch every day.
